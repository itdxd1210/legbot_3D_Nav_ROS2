Legbot is a ROS 2 Jazzy workspace for 3D navigation with the Unitree GO2. It connects LiDAR-inertial odometry, local and multi-floor planning, reinforcement-learning locomotion, Gazebo simulation, and a guarded GO2 EDU hardware interface in one launch structure.

## Highlights

- ROS 2 Jazzy integration for Ubuntu 24.04 and Gazebo Harmonic.
- FAST-LIO localization from simulated sensors, Livox devices, or the built-in Unitree L1 LiDAR.
- SCAN local planning with occupancy mapping, A* collision-segment repair, rebound B-spline optimization, direct RViz goals, queued goals, and recorded 3D routes.
- Optional PCT multi-floor reference planning and EGO local planning.
- TorchScript and ONNX Runtime policy backends for GO2 locomotion.
- Three validated policy profiles: `moe_cts_77k` (default), `go2_cts`, and `mjlab_flat`.
- Separate simulation and hardware launch paths. Motor commands are disabled by default on the real-robot path.
- Offline checks for launch descriptions, dependencies, policy files, and waypoint state transitions.

## Dependencies

Install ROS 2 Jazzy Desktop and the standard development tools first. The workspace additionally requires ros2_control, ros-gz, PCL, Eigen, OpenCV, yaml-cpp, Fast DDS, NumPy, SciPy, and the ROS packages declared in each `package.xml`.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-dev-tools python3-rosdep python3-vcstool \
  libeigen3-dev libpcl-dev libopencv-dev libyaml-cpp-dev \
  ros-jazzy-ros-gz ros-jazzy-ros2-control ros-jazzy-ros2-controllers \
  ros-jazzy-pcl-ros ros-jazzy-cv-bridge ros-jazzy-tf2-sensor-msgs \
  ros-jazzy-backward-ros ros-jazzy-rmw-fastrtps-cpp
sudo rosdep init 2>/dev/null || true
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Large local runtimes are deliberately excluded from Git. Before building, provide:

```text
third_party/libtorch
third_party/onnxruntime
third_party/unitree_sdk2/install
third_party/Livox-SDK2/install
third_party/pct/install
.deps/diagnostic_updater_4.2.7/opt/ros/jazzy/lib
```

Pinned SDK revisions are listed in [`docs/SENSOR_SDK_UPSTREAM_LOCK.json`](docs/SENSOR_SDK_UPSTREAM_LOCK.json); policy files and hashes are listed in [`docs/GO2_POLICY_MODELS_LOCK.json`](docs/GO2_POLICY_MODELS_LOCK.json). LibTorch must use the C++11 ABI. The current workspace setup uses ONNX Runtime 1.23.2.

## Build and verify

```bash
git clone --branch ROS2 https://github.com/Robot-Nav/legbot_3D_Nav.git
cd legbot_3D_Nav

./tools/build.sh
source tools/env.sh
./tools/check_offline.sh
```

`check_offline.sh` does not start Gazebo and does not connect to a robot. A successful run ends with:

```text
PASS offline checks; no simulation or robot experiment was started by this check
```

## Quick start: combined-terrain simulation

Open one terminal per command and run `source tools/env.sh` in every new terminal.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Gazebo and the GO2 controller
ros2 launch legbot_bringup simulation.launch.py gui:=true

# Terminal 2: stand-up and navigation state machine
ros2 launch legbot_bringup go2_demo_control.launch.py

# Terminal 3: LiDAR-inertial odometry
ros2 launch legbot_bringup fastlio.launch.py use_sim_time:=true \
  config:=$PWD/install/legbot_bringup/share/legbot_bringup/config/fastlio_sim.yaml

# Terminal 4: local planner
ros2 launch legbot_bringup scan.launch.py use_sim_time:=true

# Terminal 5: visualization
ros2 launch legbot_bringup scan_rviz.launch.py

# Terminal 6: RViz goal handler (direct replacement by default)
ros2 launch legbot_bringup scan_waypoints.launch.py
```

Wait for `IMU Initial Done` and `FAST-LIO ready: enabling SCAN waypoint mission`, then use **2D Goal Pose** in RViz. The default navigation source is FAST-LIO; Gazebo ground truth is not fed into the control chain.

The sole built-in world is `Building.sdf`: the GO2 starts in a western flat
field containing 30 cylinders and three traversable arch gates, then continues
into the dark blue-grey multi-storey Building staircase in the eastern half.

To execute the complete autonomous connector and PCT cross-floor route, use
the all-in-one launch instead of the six-terminal sequence:

```bash
ros2 launch legbot_bringup pct_cross_floor_demo.launch.py
```

This long cross-floor demo uses drift-free Gazebo odometry by default while
retaining the PCT global route, SCAN local avoidance, and GO2 controller. Pass
`navigation_source:=fastlio` specifically for localization-integration tests.

See the [complete run guide](运行指南.md) for headless mode, stairs, queued goals, 3D route recording, PCT, EGO, diagnostics, and shutdown order.

## Real robot safety

The hardware launch defaults to `enable_commands:=false`. Start with the read-only preflight:

```bash
./tools/go2_real_preflight.sh <ethernet-interface>
```

It checks the `192.168.123.x` link, joint state, body IMU, L1 IMU, and LiDAR fields without publishing `LowCmd`. Do not enable commands until the network interface, sensor timestamps, extrinsics, emergency stop, support rig, and operator responsibilities have been checked on site.

## Algorithms

FAST-LIO performs tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU state estimation with an iterated error-state Kalman filter. SCAN maintains a probabilistic sliding occupancy map, repairs colliding path segments with A*, and minimizes a weighted B-spline objective:

$$J = \lambda_s J_{smooth} + \lambda_c J_{collision} + \lambda_f J_{feasibility} + \lambda_r J_{reference}.$$

The controller converts the policy action into a joint target and applies PD control:

$$q_d = q_0 + s_a a, \qquad \tau = K_p(q_d-q)-K_d\dot q,$$

followed by the configured torque limits. The default `moe_cts_77k` profile uses ten 45-dimensional observation frames in term-major order, producing a 450-dimensional ONNX input and 12 joint actions.

For the complete derivation, parameter interpretation, topic flow, validation results, and known limitations, read [docs/PROJECT_ANALYSIS_CN.md](docs/PROJECT_ANALYSIS_CN.md).

## Project status

The Gazebo flat-ground navigation loop and the default policy have been exercised with FAST-LIO and SCAN. Stair locomotion has been tested at the dynamics level. Real-hardware actuation is intentionally not claimed as validated: site-specific networking, calibration, state estimation, and low-speed command release remain operator acceptance items.
